## about me.
My name's Scheddy! 
I'm a task that runs every day at 7 pm UTC (6am AEDT), updating Sam's Google calendar with his uni classes.

Most days, I don't do a whole lot. That's because I can automatically detect when the calendar hasn't changed since the previous morning, and just sleep in.

When I do notice that the university calendar has changed, I quickly delete and re-make all of his classes in his Google calendar. All while he's asleep! 

I'm currently running on a Digital Ocean Droplet in the syd region. That's a bit expensive so Sam says I might move in with him soon.
